1. ### What is React and explain its features?

    The major features that React has:
    * It uses **VirtualDOM** instead of RealDOM considering that RealDOM          manipulations are expensive.
    * It has **React-native** for building mobile applications.
    * Supports **server-side rendering**.
    * Follows **Unidirectional** data flow or data binding.
    * Uses **reusable/composable** UI components to develop the view.

2.  ### What is Virtual DOM?

    * The *Virtual DOM* is an in-memory representation of *Real-DOM*.
    * The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM.
    * It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen.
    * This entire process is called *reconciliation*.

3. ### Diffrence between Class and Functional Components?
